J000441+124922 - vlssr source to the left seems associated with nvss far left
                 source; need to include for consistency's sake
J002442-420208 - remove sumss source, looks like sidelobe emission
J002619-150423 - vlssr looks noisy, also left hand component missing in vlssr
                 image, so discard vlssr from match
